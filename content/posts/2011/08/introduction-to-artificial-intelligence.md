The class runs from Sept 26 through Dec 16, 2011. While this class is being offered online, it is also taught at Stanford University, where it continues to be a popular intro-level class on AI. For the online version, the instructors aim to offer identical materials, assignments, and exams, and to use the same grading criteria. Both instructors will be available for online discussions.

A high speed internet connection is recommended as most of the course content will be video based. Access to a copy of [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) is also suggested.

**Course Description**

This course is 10 weeks long. The in-class version starts Tue, Sept 27. The online version begins Mon, Oct 2, 2011. The course consists of
Approximately 20 lectures. Each lecture includes quizzes that we ask you to do, but which are not counted towards the final grade of this class. Instead, you can see the right answer to each quizz right after submitting your answers.

Approximately 8 homework assignments. Those are just like our quizzes, and if you do well in the quizzes, you should do well in the assignments. However, we won't show you the correct answer only with a few days delay, to discourage cheating.
One midterm and one final exam. These are like extended quizzes, covering all subject areas of the course discussed so far. The exams will also check your general knowledge about topics covered in the reading materials (the book).

The central objective is to teach basic methods in AI, and to convey enthusiasm for the field. AI has emerged as one of the most impactful disciplines in science and technology. Google, for example, is massively run on AI. Students passing this course should be proficient basic methods of AI, and have a broad overview of the field.q
