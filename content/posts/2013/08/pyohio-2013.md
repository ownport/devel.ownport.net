**Keeping library compatible with Python 2.6-3.4 using python-systemd as example**

How hard is it to port a library to python 3? How much work is it going forward? Based on two examples (a pure Python, and a C-extension-based library), I want to show how in my experience the work required is modest, without significant impact on old code. At the same time, keeping Python2 compatibility constrains development under Python 3 because only the common subset of features can be used.

**My Adventures with Mock**

Mock is a powerful testing library. Unfortunately, there seems to be a trend of confusion and distress among those who are just getting started with Mock. This talk will highlight my experience learning Mock, and will list a few of the patterns that I've seen emerge during my quest for 100% test coverage.

**Python + FUSE**

FUSE allows you to fake a filesystem in your userspace without mucking around in the kernel. This allows you to do things like showing remote cloud-based backup products as local filesystems. This talk explores such an implementation for mounting a Copy.com account as a local filesystem, and addresses some of the common gotchas to help you implement a FUSE layer for your preferred service.

**Saturday Morning BreakfastSerial: Hacking Arduinos in Python**

Normally when you want to hack on a sweet hardware project, you bust out your Arduino and start coding in what may as well be C. We as Python developers know that sucks! Introducing BreakfastSerial, a framework that makes it super simple to interact with Arduinos using just Python. In this session, you'll learn the basics, see some fun demos, and become a hardware-hacking pro in no time flat.

**Super Advanced Python**

In this tutorial we will touch on some of the more complex features of the Python programming language including, functional tools(filter map reduce), itertools, metaclasses, decorators and more.

**APIs made for mobile networks**

The Python and web development communities have gotten pretty good at writing REST APIs for browsers and desktop clients. But porting that to the high-latency wild-west of mobile networks requires a paradigm shift. Learn how you can speed up your mobile API using proven technologies - and avoid writing your own protocol!

**Code Reading Python**

You know enough Python now to write small programs, but you want to be able to write bigger ones. A good step towards that is studying existing programs, and open source provides lots to learn from. You may even want to choose one so you can contribute to it.

Reading code is an acquired skill, we will explore ways to do that effectively.

**Flasky Goodness**

This talk dives into Service-Oriented Architecture and why Django isn't always the best tool for the job. We'll overview the Flask web framework, and how it can be a great fit for distributed applications.

**Large scale network analysis w/ python and igraph**

Networks are a convenient way to model messy problems. I will talk about my 2.5 year sideproject, my ambitious attempt to map and model the nuance and beautiful complexity of the twittersphere.

**Pika and Queues**

In a world of distributed programming and asynchronous web apps, a dedicated message passing service is useful. Enter the Asynchronous Message Queue Protocol(AMQP) and Pika python library. With RabbitMQ as our AMQP provider, we will explore the use of Pika to setup a workqueue between two services, distribute tasks between workers, setup a PubSub service, and improve responsiveness of websites.
